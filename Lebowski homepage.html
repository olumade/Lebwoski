He was... he was one of us.He was a man who love the outdooors,and bowling,and as a surfer explained the beaches of souther California from Redondo to Calabassos. And he was an avid bowler.And a good friend. He died-he died as so many of his generation,befoer his time. in your wisdom you took him, Lord. As you took so many bright flowering young men, at Khe San and Lac Don. </p>
