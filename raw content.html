Isn't, Larry?And I,m talkin' about the Dude here-sometimes there's a man who,wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there and that's the Dude, in Los Angeles.
    
   Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:Her life is in your hands. They're nihinists. Now this story i'm about to unfold took place back in the early ninities-just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies. I only mention it 'cause some-times there's a man-i won't say a hee-no 'cause what's a hee-ro?-but sometimes there's a man. Our basic freedoms.
